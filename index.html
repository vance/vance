    <h1>Vance Marco Feldman's ForeverScape</h1>
    <p>The ForeverScape is larger than Banksy, Thomas Kinkade, M.C. Escher and Salvidor Dali combined. Heironymous Bosch is trapped in the world's largest psychedelic illustration. It is a composite image of hundreds of pages of paper. It all began as ballpoint pen and slowly progressed into full-color epic journey through space, sea, earth and all the windy spaces in between. The artist pledges to continue drawing it until "death do them part." Vance's visionary art has been praised by all who lay eyes upon it, but his insecurity and obsession drives him to continue expanding the universe regardless of public opinion.</p>

            <p >The ForeverScape is a physical drawing on nearly 1,000 individually connected sheets of paper. It measures over <i style="color:#ffca00">2.5 football fields long</i> and grows at the rate of one page every two days. It also tiles vertically, standing over 120 feet tall in a periodic arrangement, or about 15 stories from floor to ceiling.</p>
